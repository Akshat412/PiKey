# PiKey
This is a SoM (System-on-Module) for the RP2040 microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. The module is based on a 2242 M.2 B+M card (2.2 cm x 4.2 cm) and can be plugged into M.2 B or M connectors.

The module can be used for any project requiring a microcontroller, and would save a lot of time in board design and assembly as well as cost, as it implements all of the required peripherals for working with an RP2040 microcontroller. Any projects using this would just need to be carrier boards for this SoM. This was inspired by Phil's Lab, who made a similar module for an STM32, and timonsku, who made a similar module for the RP2040 and also open-sourced the M.2 card footprint for KiCad!
